# Raremedia Frontend Dev Role 2hr Practical

This repo contains assets and instructions for a practical exercise designed to show us your approach and thought processes in regard to frontend web development.

You're welcome to use any information resources you like and build against any platform or support tools you like to use.

We don't want you to spend more than 2.5 hours working on this prac, we don't expect 100% completion we just want to see your approach in detail.

It could be beneficial to write some brief notes about how you would have continued on with the project outside of the time limit.

We don't expect you to setup anything related to publishing or backend at all, please disregard anything that isn't purely frontend. No need for build processes, dev environments, backend logic etc.
